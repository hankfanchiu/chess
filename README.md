# Chess

A complete command-line interface chess game to demonstrate class interaction, inheritance, polymorphism, and keeping code DRY.

## Usage

To play the game, clone the repository and execute the game file, `chess.rb` in the terminal.

## Gameplay

The chess game allows both human and computer players:

The AI for the computer player is set to take any killable enemy piece first. Otherwise, it makes a random move.
