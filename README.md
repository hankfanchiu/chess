# Chess

An App Academy project to demonstrate class interaction, inheritance, polymorphism, and keeping code DRY

## Gameplay

A complete chess game with both human and computer players:

The AI for the computer player is set to kill any killable enemy first. Otherwise, it makes a random movement.

If two computer players are playing against each other, the game ends when either one color wins or a stalemate is reached.
